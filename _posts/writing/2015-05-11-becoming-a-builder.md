# Becoming a builder

Those of you who know me, know that I like building things, whether it
be [automation](http://chef.io), [distributed
systems](http://kafka.apache.org), [communities](http://hangops.com), or
[culture](http://devopsdays.org).

I've been at Lookout for a little over a year now and in my time there
I've had some unique experiences, made some great friendships, and grown
immensely as an Operations Engineer, in my experience with JVM based
services like ZooKeeper, Kafka, Cassandra, Storm, in my skills with Chef
and Ruby, and in helping herd distributed system through production
operations in the cloud.

But recently a unique opportunity presented itself for me to work with
my long time friend [Mathias Meyer](http://twitter.com/roidrage) and so
on June 1, 2015 I'll be joining [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.com),
working remotely from Los Angeles, as part of their Operations team and
become the latest _builder_ in an amazing team of builders.

You'll still see me in the the usual "devops tools" communities online
(Chef, Terraform, etc), I'll continue to herd Hangops, and I'm excited
to get to be behind the scenes and help in powering a ton of the open
source software community.
