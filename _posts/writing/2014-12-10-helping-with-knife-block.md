# Helping with knife-block

We make heavy use of [knife-block](https://github.com/knife-block/knife-block) in [Lookout Operations](https://twitter.com/lookout) and yesterday we encountered [an issue with it and Chef 12's knife](https://github.com/knife-block/knife-block/issues/25).

I really appreciate all the work [Matthew Macdonald-Wallace](https://twitter.com/ProfFalken) put into making knife-block and also his transparency in not having time/need to work on it anymore.

Last night I [reached out to him](https://twitter.com/ProfFalken/status/542607454178406400) about moving knife-block to its own [Github org](https://github.com/knife-block/) and taking over maintainence of the project. He was [awesome enough to say yes](https://twitter.com/ProfFalken/status/542608021097308160).

If you're an active user of knife-block, and especially if you'd like to help maintain it, [let me know on Twitter!](https://twitter.com/) or file [Github issues](https://github.com/knife-block/knife-block/issues).
