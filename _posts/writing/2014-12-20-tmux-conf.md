# tmux.conf

I spent a while this morning putting together a new [tmux.conf](https://github.com/solarce/dotfiles/blob/master/tmux.conf) and I've added it to my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/solarce/dotfiles) on Github.

I'm gonna try to re-organize my [tmux tips](http://www.solarce.org/tips/tmux.html) page around it here soon.

Let me know what you think on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solarce)
